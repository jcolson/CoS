# Moradin
(pronounced: _MOR-a-din_[29](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moradin#cite_note-D93-APG-p28-29) or: _MOR-uh-din_[8](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moradin#cite_note-FaP-p121-8)) was the [lawful good](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lawful_good "Lawful good") god of the [dwarves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarves "Dwarves") and the chief deity in [their pantheon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarven_pantheon "Dwarven pantheon"). A harsh but fair judge, he was strength and force of will embodied. He inspired dwarven inventions and constantly sought to improve their race, encouraging a good natured, intelligent, and harmonious existence with other good races while battling their pride and isolationist tendencies.
