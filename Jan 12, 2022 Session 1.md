# Jan 12, 2022 Session 1

Town is [Hannat](Hannat.md) where we are at - first establishment in mountains  
east of the swamp

[The Crying Pony](The%20Crying%20Pony.md) -- inn

[Sedwig](Sedwig.md) - barman - human - chubby - really happy to give legal and questionable services - well known as a fence  
already preparing drinks for us  
pased me a parchment

adventuring board in taverns - w have used for previous levels

written in common - 8 year old simply worded  
not [Sedwig](Sedwig.md)'s writing  
I recognize the handwriting - it's far from a child  
"certain followers of evil that are fighting close by get loot get paid"  
bear logo in corner - message has been sent by my contact [Iron the Bonker](Iron%20the%20Bonker.md)

[Bloodbear Clan](Bloodbear%20Clan.md) member - one more word - after investigations, meet at the [Valley Fighting Pit](Valley%20Fighting%20Pit.md) very close by - very favored by the bears - disputes are settled there - 30 minutes walk to the west

---

golden eyes - Tiefling - [Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md) recognizes - so does [Quinn](Quinn.md)  
her name is [Rothorn](Rothorn.md)

[The Circle](The%20Circle.md) has informed her of a battle - certain followers and dragons that interacted with each other - highly recommend going in this area.  [The Circle](The%20Circle.md) trying to regain control of certain territories that dragon's occupied

gives Duff of Smoke bottle to [Quinn](Quinn.md).  Language Potion to [Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md)

she's a student of divination  
uncover strange artifacts/etc - will be compensated by [Rothorn](Rothorn.md)

[Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md) says he's here for investigation, not to do the [The Circle](The%20Circle.md)'s bidding - dead valley.

[Vormorn](Vormorn.md) hears about battlefield - can take anyone with them

it's 8am

---

[Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md) leads us to desolated area - some parts are churned some are foggy with green merk  
hundreds of corpses - recent battle  
carrion birds swarming around - death/blood/shit smell  
very very sour in air - poisonous in the air that has been used for attack

this came from a humanoid level - most likely not dragon

[Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md) looks panicked by all the death - looking at fog, "just like back home" -- nature check - 6+5=11  
recognize two specific symbols -   
one golden stitched sun symbol - on shoulder, some burnt into neck  
very strange monstrosities that ooze poison from their fangs, might be able to ride them

[Quinn](Quinn.md) roll to search for survivors  
may have been here for a while, but smells are very fresh

3 hills - in between there is slight curve - where most clashes happened

investigate the dead:  
find strange individual - big red robe - reinforced shoulder pads and hat - pulled down to eyes - also ending in pointing shape on top  
seems diff sun symbols burned into neck  
they seem to have a tome of some sort attached to body with chain

the wind shifts - and fresh air hits us

in back, huge black spear - chain all over them

[Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md) gets book - it's in draconic - [Quinn](Quinn.md) reads it  
there is a strange time calc - 72nd year of [The New Dawn](The%20New%20Dawn.md)

mentions:  
[Kraz Lagan the Menacing](Kraz%20Lagan%20the%20Menacing.md)  fanatic ramblings and weird achievements -   
mentioned "[Crimson Dawn](Crimson%20Dawn.md) may never seize" - maybe the name of the Sun symbols group of dead.  
[The Biled](The%20Biled.md) - is the other group

something catches [Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md) ear - something skittering to the north - there are a couple of people moving through the corpses

on furthest hill - some with similar red robes and yellow endings and some with rag-tagged - they are scavenging - there are five of them.

[Quinn](Quinn.md) sneaks through bodies and sees --> figure has four chains that are attached to beasts that are hunched over that are harvesting body parts (ears/odd equipment)   
some have three clawed endings

[DH DM](DH%20DM.md) rolled d8 got 8 inspiration points each

2 come before -  
[Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md) and [Vormorn](Vormorn.md)

we destroy the holder ... and one of the beasts, and the rest of the beasts run off.  they look to be made up of different humanoids.  find 3 gold pieces, minor healing potion and a scroll that mentions the ruin at [The Old Scar](The%20Old%20Scar.md)

Investigate the woods where the Dark Dwarf summoned [Vormorn](Vormorn.md) ... find half a corpse.  
[Blackened liquid glassy metallic blade](Blackened%20liquid%20glassy%20metallic%20blade.md) - pierced through it all the way into the tree.  
[Quinn](Quinn.md) tries to take the blade, and it cuts his hands.  
[Vormorn](Vormorn.md) uses some forging equipment tongs to grip the very sharp blade, and pulls it out of the tree.  He places it in his backpack.

The Deadly Black - alcove - found book - mentions [Kraz Lagan the Menacing](Kraz%20Lagan%20the%20Menacing.md)

We find a statue missing one hand (on purpose) (inscription "protector of the innocent") and an alter.  find inscription that states to "close eyes and look into shadows".

[Quinn](Quinn.md) approaches the one corner that is darkened and the alter moves aside, exposing an entrance to a chamber.

It ends up being a laboratory.  6 tubes, one green, the rest red.  body in the green tube, looks to be creating the beasts.

investigated a cell, found a dragon headed woman.  says [Crimson Dawn](Crimson%20Dawn.md) must pay.  will give us a favor if we free her.  She built this place. She says to show [Barnabus The Churned](Barnabus%20The%20Churned.md) a good time by using his own staff on himself.

She leaves when we enter room with a bony figure. - We forgot to get her name.

Room has a fresco painting on ceiling, 3 pegasus.

Bony figure is most likely [Barnabus The Churned](Barnabus%20The%20Churned.md) - he has ears pinned to the wall.

Battle begins - he says [Azutrix](Azutrix.md)'s power shall punish you.  
He's bloodied.

Dragon snake turns magically blue.  
The staff was blue, turns a natural green now.

[Quinn](Quinn.md) takes [Green Staff](Green%20Staff.md).

we run out of crumbling lab, it collapses behind us and is completely destroyed.

Staff seems to say "Nature is on your side".  [Jolo Brekk](Jolo%20Brekk.md) recognizes the staff and [Quinn](Quinn.md) gives it to him.

---

We return to the [The Crying Pony](The%20Crying%20Pony.md).  
Minting of dragon beads take human blood.  
Book was written by *Duergar* - [Rothorn](Rothorn.md) gives 200g for it.

we get positive influence with [The Circle](The%20Circle.md) and [Gatekeepers](Gatekeepers.md)

Dark dwarf ([Iron the Bonker](Iron%20the%20Bonker.md)) comes barging into [The Crying Pony](The%20Crying%20Pony.md) and puts his head in [Vormorn](Vormorn.md)'s gut.  "Where's my stuff??"
