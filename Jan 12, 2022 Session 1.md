# Jan 12, 2022 Session 1

Town is [[Hannat]] where we are at - first establishment in mountains
east of the swamp

[[The Crying Pony]] -- inn

[[Sedwig]] - barman - human - chubby - really happy to give legal and questionable services - well known as a fence
already preparing drinks for us
pased me a parchment

adventuring board in taverns - w have used for previous levels

written in common - 8 year old simply worded
not [[Sedwig]]'s writing
I recognize the handwriting - it's far from a child
"certain followers of evil that are fighting close by get loot get paid"
bear logo in corner - message has been sent by my contact [[Iron the Bonker]]

[[Bloodbear Clan]] member - one more word - after investigations, meet at the [[Valley Fighting Pit]] very close by - very favored by the bears - disputes are settled there - 30 minutes walk to the west

---

golden eyes - Tiefling - [[Jolo Brekk]] recognizes - so does [[Quinn]]
her name is [[Rothorn]]

[[The Circle]] has informed her of a battle - certain followers and dragons that interacted with each other - highly recommend going in this area.  [[The Circle]] trying to regain control of certain territories that dragon's occupied

gives Duff of Smoke bottle to [[Quinn]].  Language Potion to [[Jolo Brekk]]

she's a student of divination
uncover strange artifacts/etc - will be compensated by [[Rothorn]]

[[Jolo Brekk]] says he's here for investigation, not to do the [[The Circle]]'s bidding - dead valley.

[[Vormorn]] hears about battlefield - can take anyone with them

it's 8am

---
[[Jolo Brekk]] leads us to desolated area - some parts are churned some are foggy with green merk
hundreds of corpses - recent battle
carrion birds swarming around - death/blood/shit smell
very very sour in air - poisonous in the air that has been used for attack

this came from a humanoid level - most likely not dragon

[[Jolo Brekk]] looks panicked by all the death - looking at fog, "just like back home" -- nature check - 6+5=11
recognize two specific symbols - 
one golden stitched sun symbol - on shoulder, some burnt into neck
very strange monstrosities that ooze poison from their fangs, might be able to ride them

[[Quinn]] roll to search for survivors
may have been here for a while, but smells are very fresh

3 hills - in between there is slight curve - where most clashes happened

investigate the dead:
find strange individual - big red robe - reinforced shoulder pads and hat - pulled down to eyes - also ending in pointing shape on top
seems diff sun symbols burned into neck
they seem to have a tome of some sort attached to body with chain

the wind shifts - and fresh air hits us

in back, huge black spear - chain all over them

[[Jolo Brekk]] gets book - it's in draconic - [[Quinn]] reads it
there is a strange time calc - 72nd year of [[The New Dawn]]

mentions:
[[Kraz Lagan the Menacing]]  fanatic ramblings and weird achievements - 
mentioned "[[Crimson Dawn]] may never seize" - maybe the name of the Sun symbols group of dead.
[[The Biled]] - is the other group

something catches [[Jolo Brekk]] ear - something skittering to the north - there are a couple of people moving through the corpses

on furthest hill - some with similar red robes and yellow endings and some with rag-tagged - they are scavenging - there are five of them.

[[Quinn]] sneaks through bodies and sees --> figure has four chains that are attached to beasts that are hunched over that are harvesting body parts (ears/odd equipment) 
some have three clawed endings

[[DH DM]] rolled d8 got 8 inspiration points each

2 come before -
[[Jolo Brekk]] and [[Vormorn]]

we destroy the holder ... and one of the beasts, and the rest of the beasts run off.  they look to be made up of different humanoids.  find 3 gold pieces, minor healing potion and a scroll that mentions the ruin at [[The Old Scar]]

Investigate the woods where the Dark Dwarf summoned [[Vormorn]] ... find half a corpse.
[[Blackened liquid glassy metallic blade]] - pierced through it all the way into the tree.
[[Quinn]] tries to take the blade, and it cuts his hands.
[[Vormorn]] uses some forging equipment tongs to grip the very sharp blade, and pulls it out of the tree.  He places it in his backpack.

The Deadly Black - alcove - found book - mentions [[Kraz Lagan the Menacing]]

We find a statue missing one hand (on purpose) (inscription "protector of the innocent") and an alter.  find inscription that states to "close eyes and look into shadows".

[[Quinn]] approaches the one corner that is darkened and the alter moves aside, exposing an entrance to a chamber.

It ends up being a laboratory.  6 tubes, one green, the rest red.  body in the green tube, looks to be creating the beasts.

investigated a cell, found a dragon headed woman.  says [[Crimson Dawn]] must pay.  will give us a favor if we free her.  She built this place. She says to show [[Barnabus The Churned]] a good time by using his own staff on himself.

She leaves when we enter room with a bony figure. - We forgot to get her name.

Room has a fresco painting on ceiling, 3 pegasus.

Bony figure is most likely [[Barnabus The Churned]] - he has ears pinned to the wall.

Battle begins - he says [[Azutrix]]'s power shall punish you.
He's bloodied.

Dragon snake turns magically blue.
The staff was blue, turns a natural green now.

[[Quinn]] takes [[Green Staff]].  

we run out of crumbling lab, it collapses behind us and is completely destroyed.

Staff seems to say "Nature is on your side".  [[Jolo Brekk]] recognizes the staff and [[Quinn]] gives it to him.

---
We return to the [[The Crying Pony]].
Minting of dragon beads take human blood.
Book was written by [[Duergar]] - [[Rothorn]] gives 200g for it.

we get positive influence with [[The Circle]] and [[Gatekeepers]]

Dark dwarf ([[Iron the Bonker]]) comes barging into [[The Crying Pony]] and puts his head in [[Vormorn]]'s gut.  "Where's my stuff??"
