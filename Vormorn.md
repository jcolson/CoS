[The Forger](The%20Forger.md) (and my contract with him)

After one nightmare - get strange conversation with smithy, skin made of shiny black metal/stone, eyes shine with sparkly blue light, but beard as dwarf, large as a giant. Offer me to prove myself - see my soul. Get back at intruders. Good relations with bears. Only because started meeting up with them and got a liking to me,. But I'm good at craft, good shit. Draconic stuff, old bones, old skin, much thinner than dragons hide. Turn them into shields ... have a connection with them, [The Forger](The%20Forger.md) is just my.
