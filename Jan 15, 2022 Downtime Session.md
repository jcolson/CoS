# Jan 15, 2022 Downtime Session
```ad-quote
[[Iron the Bonker]], after headbutting your stomach, pulls you out with one hand and brings you to a water barrel. He keeps shouting something along the lines of how you're betraying his trust and how an empty hand is always ready to pull a dagger. (he expects you to explain what happened with you in the past couple of days and whether you have something for the [[Bloodbear Clan]])
```

[[Vormorn]] explains that he took advantage of the fact that two other adventurers where already going to investigate the "Certain Followers of Evil that are fighting close by" (from the message that [[Iron the Bonker]] had left him through [[Sedwig]]).  He explains the encounters that he had in the battlefield as well as at [[The Old Scar]], as well as mentioning seeing the dark dwarf summoning him.  "I was just about to leave and head to the [[Valley Fighting Pit]] to meet with you."  "Here, I did bring something back, maybe you know a bit more about this triangular gold piece.  There seemed to be a lot of them, but the laboratory where we encountered [[Barnabus The Churned]] was completely destroyed and buried a serious amount of them."  "I bring [[Bloodbear Clan]] a lot of information, as well as questions ...  [[Azutrix]] is evidently a rising diety of the [[Crimson Dawn]] that we must investigate."

[14:48, 1/15/2022] Ivan (üó°Ô∏è): Azutrix? Sounds like a dragon's name. Also sounds like a great loot, once you get that slithering wyrm down. You let me know once you need to dispose of their bodies. We'll pay you as usual.
[14:49, 1/15/2022] Ivan (üó°Ô∏è): "This coin", he says, "doesn't seem useful to me. Keep it, sell it if you can. If you find a type of dragon to be giving you headaches, do tell us, and we'll bring you its bane. All of them fear or hate something. Our witches might have the right chain to pull!
[14:51, 1/15/2022] Ivan (üó°Ô∏è): => Iron (the Bonker, like, bonking with heads or fists) is pleased with the updates, but currently your status is the same with him. Should you uncover draconic loot: bodies, scales, etc. he might like you more, and provide you more assistance. Even henchmen :)
```

"Do you know of [[Azutrix]] and it's potential bane?  There is also another wyrm in which I have interest in killing ...  [[Agathrax]] - do you know of this one?""

After speaking with [[Iron the Bonker]], [[Vormorn]] locates the local Armorers or Smithing guild in [[Hannat]] and show his Letter of Guild Introduction to become a local member.  He would like to inquire of any requests for fine armor or weapon smithing that he could work on fulfilling to prove himself locally.

After joining the guild, he'd like to be introduced to the town's local governor and/or other political seniors in order to determine whether it would be worth his time investing himself in the local politics of [[Hannat]].

also he'll try to find someone in the guild that can 'identify' this black glassy blade

[20:54, 1/15/2022] Ivan (üó°Ô∏è): "I'll ask the Sages. I've not heard of such beast ([[Agathrax]]). Maybe we've killed it before. [[Azutrix]] you say. No, no news yet. I'll ask my brethren about it too. Meanwhile, hunt some scraps for us, will ya?"

=> the smiths ask for a 10 gold entry fee per annum for the smithing tools. For the first month you cannot earn anything with your craft (because frankly, they don't trust you yet).

No current requests came in, only banal jobs like horseshoeing, repairing some plate mails for [[Lion's Pride]] members, etc. that's how you got to hear of a dragonborn named [[Blackscar]]. He looks nobleborn, but has a quite menacing aura.

=> currently your status is not too high for the locals at [[Hannat]] to take interest in you. But, you got your membership sorted and got to know some of the local players :)
[20:55, 1/15/2022] Ivan (üó°Ô∏è): the [[Blackened liquid glassy metallic blade]] material is not known to anyone here. But, during your stay you could figure out that it cannot simply be heated up, like other metals. Either it's boiling point is much higher than normal, or you'd need to do some other sort of thing to make it change shape.
```

"[[Iron the Bonker]], I'll be in touch as soon as my travels and adventures turn up something more interesting to the [[Bloodbear Clan]].  Thank you for looking into [[Agathrax]] in the meantime."

[[Vormorn]] pays the 10g fee, knowing full well that he'll be able to impress the guild with his fine work and earn plenty more than the guild fee in short order.  He works on the menial jobs such as the horseshowing and plate armor repair ... he takes exceptional pride in his work, even in the small jobs that he gets, very aware that word of his work will spread through [[Hannat]], bringing more interesting work.  While working he continues to keep his ears open for any interesting discussions, including anything further in regards to this Dragonborn, [[Blackscar]]...

[[Blackscar]] doesn't speak much, but keeps coming back with chipped weapons and armor. Looks like he's been constantly fighting with things that have sharp teeth and claws
